Whether you are a beginner programmer or have been coding for years; you should always
endeavour to improve your technical and problem-solving skills. It is time for you, your
programming partner, and your rubber ducky to get programming!

Create three functions with different uses.
1. Write a function to square a number.
2. Write a function which checks if any given number is odd or even.
3. Write a function which calculates the average in a list of numbers.
